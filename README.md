# CyberSec_Task8_VPN_Analysis

## üéØ Objective
[cite_start]The primary objective of this task was to gain a hands-on understanding of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**, their role in **protecting privacy**, and their function in facilitating **secure communication**[cite: 6].

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* **VPN Client:** Turbo VPN (Used to establish a secure tunnel)
* **IP Verification Tool:** WhatIsMyIPAddress.com or similar service (Used to verify the change in public IP address)
* **Documentation:** Screenshot utility, Markdown, and GitHub

## üìù Steps Performed (Mini Guide Implementation)

1.  [cite_start]**VPN Selection and Installation:** Selected and installed a free VPN client (Turbo VPN)[cite: 10, 11].
2.  [cite_start]**Server Connection:** Connected to multiple remote VPN servers (e.g., Australia - Sydney and United States - San Francisco)[cite: 12].
3.  [cite_start]**IP Verification:** Verified the public IP address changed successfully by checking it on `whatismyipaddress.com`[cite: 13]. The IP address matched the selected VPN server location.
4.  [cite_start]**Traffic Confirmation:** Browsed several websites while connected to confirm traffic was being routed and encrypted through the VPN tunnel[cite: 14].
5.  [cite_start]**Comparison and Disconnect:** Disconnected the VPN, confirmed the IP reverted to the local address, and compared general browsing speed with the VPN on versus off[cite: 15].
6.  [cite_start]**Research:** Conducted research on core VPN concepts, including encryption protocols and privacy features[cite: 16].

## üìä Deliverables and Findings

### 1. Connection Status Screenshot
[cite_start]A screenshot confirming a successful VPN connection and the displayed virtual location.

* **EDIT THIS:** Change this to match your uploaded screenshot file names:
    * `[Australia_IP.png]`
    * `[USA_IP.png]`

### 2. Research Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations
[cite_start]A summary report detailing the advantages of using a VPN for security and privacy, as well as its limitations.

#### **A. VPN Benefits**
* **Data Encryption:** All data transferred between the user's device and the VPN server is encrypted (e.g., using protocols like OpenVPN or IKEv2), protecting it from interception by ISPs, hackers, or network administrators.
* **Privacy/Anonymity:** By masking the user's original IP address and replacing it with the server's IP, a VPN helps conceal the user's true geographical location and identity.
* **Geo-Unblocking:** VPNs allow users to access region-restricted content by making it appear as if they are browsing from the server's physical location (e.g., Australia or the US).
* **Bypassing Censorship:** They can circumvent restrictive network filters or government censorship blocks.

#### **B. VPN Limitations**
* [cite_start]**Speed Reduction:** Encrypting and routing data through a distant server naturally adds overhead, often resulting in a noticeable reduction in internet speed and increased latency[cite: 28].
* **Not Complete Anonymity:** A VPN does not guarantee complete anonymity. [cite_start]If the VPN provider keeps logs (a practice known as "logging"), a user's activity could potentially be traced back to them[cite: 25].
* **Trust in the Provider:** The user is essentially transferring trust from their ISP to the VPN provider. Choosing a disreputable VPN can lead to data logging, malware injection, or other privacy issues.
* **Cost:** While free tiers exist, the most reliable VPN services with the best speeds and security often require a paid subscription.
